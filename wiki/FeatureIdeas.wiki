= Car Movement Ideas =

 * Variable unloading times.  Let some cargo require two days to unload, and others one.
 * Add support for setting minimum and maximum train lengths.
 * Provide siding length for each industry, and make sure there's space for cars being dropped off.
 * Make sure all switchlists and documents are presenting door assignments, and sorting lists by door.
 * Support advanced features - cleanout and scale, and icing tracks.  (Requires more explicit yard instructions?)

= Setup Ideas =
 * Automatically create cargos based on the OPSIG Industry lists.
 * Automatically create divisions based on the railroad and location, and do an initial placement of cars in divisions.
 * Change division idea to something closer to "where is this car allowed to leave the layout?"

= Switch List Ideas = 
 * More realistic switch list forms.
 * Create better forms and documents for running an active yard.
 * Create a Coverflow-like UI for selecting the right switchlist.
 * Control blocking order more explicitly.
